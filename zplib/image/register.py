    '''Register two images via downsampling, computing a shift, and refining on the original images.

    At each downsampling ("pyramid level"), the images are shrunk two-fold. The maximum shift
    that can be identified at each level is ~5 px, so for a 3 level pyramid (original size
    images and two consecutive downsamplings, for a 4-fold maximum shrinking), a 20 pixel
    shift in the original images can be detected.

    Parameters:
        fixed_image: image for comparison
        moving_image: image that will be shifted to match the fixed_image
        levels: number of levels of the pyramid (counting the original size)
        initial_shift: (x, y) shift to begin search at.
        diff_function: image-comparison metric: one of abs_diff or square_diff
        iterate: if true, use iterate_register at each pyramid level (slower, but more accurate).
            If False, use register.
    Returns: (x, y) shift.

    To apply the identified shift to the moving image, call e.g.:
        shifted = ndimage.shift(moving_image, shift, order=1)

    The 'register()' function is repeatedly applied to find the best registration

    Parameters:
        fixed_image: image for comparison
        moving_image: image that will be shifted to match the fixed_image
        max_iters: maximum number of times register() will be called.
        initial_shift: (x, y) shift to begin search at.
        search_bounds: largest distance from initial_shift to examine.
        diff_function: image-comparison metric: one of abs_diff or square_diff
        tol: if the shift changes by less than this amount in x and y, then
