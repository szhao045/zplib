    """Produce a survival curve from a set of lifespans with optional uncertainty.

    If no uncertainty interval is provided, produce a standard, stair-step survival
    curve (which indicates infinite precision in when the time of death is known).
    Alternately, if an uncertainty interval is provided, it is assumed that the
    provided lifespan is actually +/- half of the interval. (e.g. If lifespans
    were assayed every 5 hours, provide 5 as the uncertainty interval and give
    the single lifespan as the midpoint of the interval.) In this case a non-stair-
    step plot is produced to reflect a uniform distribution of possible death times
    in that interval. This latter mode is generally preferable.

    Parameters:
        lifespans: list of point estimates of the lifespans of individuals in a
            population. This should be the middle of the interval between
            lifespan measurements.
        uncertainty_interval: Length of time between lifespan measurements.

    Returns: t, f
        t: timepoints
        f: fraction alive at each timepoint (1 to 0)
